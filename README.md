![SOMA Retargeter Banner](assets/docs/banner.gif)

Convert [SOMA](https://github.com/NVlabs/SOMA-X) human motion captures into humanoid robot joint animation. Takes BVH motion files as input and produces robot-playable CSV joint data as output using GPU-optimized inverse kinematics via [Newton](https://github.com/newton-physics/newton) and high-performance computation with [NVIDIA Warp](https://github.com/NVIDIA/warp).

The retargeting pipeline handles proportional human-to-robot scaling, multi-objective IK solving with joint limits, feet stabilization to maintain ground contact, and per-DOF joint limit clamping. Currently supports SOMA as the input skeleton and Unitree G1 (29 DOF) as the output robot. Additional robot targets are planned.

SOMA Retargeter is part of the [SOMA body model](https://github.com/NVlabs/SOMA-X) ecosystem for humanoid motion data.

> **Note:** This project is in active development. The API may change between releases as the design is refined.

## Requirements

- **Python:** 3.12
- **Git LFS:** Installed and initialized for asset downloads
- **OS:** Windows (x86-64) and Linux (x86-64, aarch64)
- **GPU:** NVIDIA GPU (Maxwell or newer), driver 545+ (CUDA 12). No local CUDA Toolkit installation required.

## Installation

<details>

<summary>Setup instructions</summary>

### Method 1 (conda + pip)

#### 1. Create and Activate Conda Environment

```bash
conda create -n soma-retargeter python=3.12 -y
conda activate soma-retargeter
```

#### 2. Download LFS Assets

```bash
git lfs pull
```

#### 3. Install the Library

```bash
pip install .
```

### Method 2 (uv)

#### 1. Install uv

Follow the [official installation guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) if `uv` is not yet installed.

#### 2. Download LFS Assets

```bash
git lfs pull
```

#### 3. Sync the Project

`uv sync` creates an isolated `.venv` virtual environment inside the project directory, installs the correct Python version and resolves all dependencies.

```bash
uv sync
```

### Platform-specific notes

**Note (Linux):** For the GUI viewer to work, install `tkinter`

```bash
sudo apt-get install python3.12-tk
```

**Note (Windows):** If `imgui-bundle` fails to install, the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributables may be missing. Download from the [official Microsoft documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist).

## Motion Data

This repo includes 10 sample BVH/CSV pairs in `assets/motions/` for immediate testing.

For large-scale motion data, see the [SEED dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/bones-studio/seed) (Skeletal Everyday Embodiment Dataset) published by [Bones Studio](https://huggingface.co/bones-studio). SEED provides a large-scale collection of human motions on the SOMA uniform-proportion skeleton, which is the expected input format for this tool. The G1 robot motion data included in SEED was retargeted using SOMA Retargeter.

## Quick Start

> When using **uv** (Method 2), replace `python` with `uv run` in the commands below.

### Interactive viewer (OpenGL)

```bash
python ./app/bvh_to_csv_converter.py --config ./assets/default_bvh_to_csv_converter_config.json --viewer gl
```

![Interactive viewer interface](assets/docs/interactive-viewer-screenshot.png)

The viewer displays the source SOMA motion alongside the retargeted robot in a 3D viewport. Use the right panel to load BVH files, run retargeting, and save CSV output. Playback controls at the bottom allow scrubbing, speed adjustment, and looping. Toggle visibility of the skinned mesh, skeleton, joint axes, and positioning gizmos.

### Batch conversion (headless)

Process a folder of BVH files without a display. Set `import_folder` and `export_folder` in the config file, then run:

```bash
python ./app/bvh_to_csv_converter.py --config ./assets/default_bvh_to_csv_converter_config.json --viewer null
```

Batch mode recursively finds all `.bvh` files in the import folder, processes them in configurable batch sizes, and writes CSV files to the export folder mirroring the input directory structure.

### BeyondMimic-compatible NPZ export

Convert a retargeted CSV into an NPZ containing joint positions/velocities and
world-space body poses/velocities. The exporter evaluates forward kinematics
with the selected Newton robot model and supports frame-rate resampling:

```bash
python ./app/csv_to_npz.py input.csv output.npz --robot chocolate --input-fps 120 --output-fps 60
```

The NPZ fields are `fps`, `joint_pos`, `joint_vel`, `body_pos_w`,
`body_quat_w` (wxyz), `body_lin_vel_w`, and `body_ang_vel_w`, with
`joint_names` and `body_names` included as metadata.

To retain all four sampling phases while converting 120 Hz CSV motion to
50 Hz NPZ, first split each CSV into four 30 Hz sequences:

```bash
python ./app/csv_phase_to_npz.py input.csv output_dir --robot chocolate
```

The input may also be a directory; CSV files are discovered recursively and
their relative directory structure is preserved.
